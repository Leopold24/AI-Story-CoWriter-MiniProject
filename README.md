# Story-Verse ü™ê

## About This Project
**Story-Verse** is an AI-powered story co-writing app that uses Google‚Äôs Gemini (for creative text) and Imagen (for AI-generated visuals). Whether you're a writer, student, or creative mind, Story-Verse helps you build compelling characters, unique storylines, and immersive worlds with just a few clicks.

## How It Works
- The app generates **character suggestions**, **story continuations**, and **bonus ideas** using Gemini Pro.
- Each suggestion includes short **AI commentary** to help you refine your ideas.
- Story progression is interactive ‚Äî you select or type your continuation, and the story unfolds in real-time.
- Visuals are generated using Imagen or Google AI Studio (via export for now).
- The app runs in a simple Streamlit interface.

## How to Run It
